    <h1>Global Rules</h1>
        <p>Global Rules apply, and are to be enforced, on every Project Invernia platform: The Wikipage, Main Discord,
            Faction Discords, In-Game, etc. <br>            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Whilst we advocate for Freedom of Speech and have very little limitation on what can and cannot be
                    said, repeated verbal or text abuse of a player causing them discomfort is considered harassment,
                    this includes but is not limited to the usage of racial or offensive slurs; know where to draw the line.
                    False allegations are also considered harassment.</li>
                <li>You may not modify your game or abuse a broken feature to give yourself an advantage over other
                    players.</li>
                <li>Spamming is not permitted on any platform. This counts for the Wikipage, Discord, and In-game
                    chats.</li>
                <li> Players may petition for a change to be made, however, unions are not permitted in any
                    circumstances. Any group threatening to boycott if certain demands are not met may be banned
                    indefinitely.</li>
                <li> If you have created an official discord server for your team or faction, you must work closely with
                    the community management.</li>
                <li> The advertising of competing communities will not be permitted. A discussion of competing
                    communities may be allowed in moderation. Communities that do not compete with ours may be
                    discussed freely.</li>
                <li>You may not impersonate any member of the community.</li>
                <li>If there is sufficient evidence that you were responsible for a DDoS attack against another member
                    of the community, you will be permanently suspended. This includes attempting to crash the server.</li>
                <li>The threat to, or the act of releasing the personal information of another member of the community,
                    without their consent, will result ina permanent suspension.</li>
                <li> Any form of donation fraud, such as unlawful chargebacks, will result in immediate and permanent
                    removal.</li>
                <li>Under no circumstances may you use an alternative account, VPN, or another person's account to
                    circumvent a ban.</li>
                <li> Failure to report a player when you are aware they are breaking major rules such as Cheating,
                    Meta Gaming, Doxxing, and all Global Rules will lead to a punishment being applied to yourself for
                    negligence. Rules such as RDM, NLR, and Fear RP are not necessary for this guideline.</li>
                <li>Erotic Roleplay (ERP) of any form is prohibited on our servers. Violations of this rule will result in
                    severe penalties. Violating this rule can result in a permanent ban from our platforms.</li>
                <li>We do not allow for any excessive controversial roleplay (I.E: Portraying ethnicities in poor
                    caricatures).</li>
                <li> You may not nuke or remove any documentation that has already been published, especially if it
                    hinders the roleplay dynamic. Additionally you may not take advantage of roleplay assets owned by
                    the Community Management (IE: databases) without proper approval from Upper Administration.
                    Documents written for any organisations must remain.

        <h2>Information</h2>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Common sense applies, do not try to loophole the rules.</li>
                <li> If you are unsure if something is allowed or not (it probably isn’t if you have to ask), feel free to ask
                    an Administrator.</li>
                <li>Not all rules are listed here, it would be impossible for us to list every scenario for example. This will
                    be updated as new precedent needs to be set. Staff have final say. If you are told to stop or not do
                    something, do as you are told or risk punishment.
                    </li>
                <li>These rules are subject to change as the server evolves and new updates come out.
                </li>
                <li>We highly recommend you record situations in order to cover your bases when roleplaying and
                    following server rules. Understand that staff cannot act upon an alleged rule break without concrete
                    evidence or having witnessed it themselves, they will often have to ask for evidence or check logs,
                    ‘witnesses’ are not admissible. Harassing our staff team will not change this requirement.</li>
                <li>The concept of ‘down time’ or ‘low player hours’ does not exist. We have a plethora of players from
                    all different time zones who want to experience the server as is. The rules are enforced 24/7, being
                    online when less players are on does not give you permission to break the server rules.

    <h1>General Rules</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>You must roleplay seriously. This includes using the correct types of chat, putting effort into
                creating detailed actions with asterisks. Anything that you say or do in-game actually happens in
                roleplay.</li>
            <li>You must have a valid RP reason to kill someone. You may attack someone if they damage your
                property (I.E: attack your horse). You may not attack someone because of their physical appearance,
                faction or simply because they insulted you. You must give someone a text warning and allow them a
                reasonable amount of time to respond before escalating the roleplay. Following this warning, you may
                kill them if they turn hostile. Do not bait someone to attack you, and do not initiate arguments to
                harass someone.</li>
            <li>As NLR kill is only put into effect during an active skirmish that has been initiated within RP
                guidelines, or at the decision of a player whilst executing a CK/PK in order to remove them asa
                witness, though this should not always be their immediate course of action. NLR killing is not
                considered RDM as long as the reason to NLR them is deemed to be appropriate, refer to rule 4 for
                NLR times. You may not CK/PK an individual for the sole purpose of NLR.</li>
            <li>The New Life Rule only applies to individual(s) who are killed, this means that any witnesses or
                perpetrators to your character's death still have the memory of the actions/crimes you committed.
                When you have been placed under the effect of NLR, you will immediately forget anyone who you have
                interacted with, or any information in which you received or witnessed within that past 15 minutes.
                Any information gained outside of that 15 minute NLR window will be considered in-character.
                </li>
            <li>You cannot roleplay as a psychopath, hitman, serial killer or any role that strictly involves killing
                other players. Any killing(s) done as a result of this kind of roleplay will be considered RDM.</li>
            <li> Upon the death of your character, you must observe the New Life Rule. This rule states that you
                must forget all events that happened and all characters you've met in the 15 minutes prior to your
                death. You may return to the location you died, although you cannot engage with the person who killed
                you or their associates for 15 minutes after your death. This does NOT apply if you were RDM'd.</li>
            <li> You must always value your own life through FearRP. Failure to abide by FearRP can result in your
                character being permanently killed.
                </li>
            <li>Any type of spam is not accepted. This includes, but is not limited to; chat spam, voice spam.
            </li>
            <li>Do not impersonate any member of the community outside of roleplay. You may pretend to be
                someone else’s character with good reason. Do not lie to staff members to gain any form of an
                advantage, as this may lead to a permanent ban.
                </li>
            <li> Respect all players when communicating outside of roleplay. You can be angry at someone, but if
                you harass or bully them you are breaking this rule.</li>
            <li> Avoidance of roleplay is not allowed. This includes but is not limited to; stalling roleplay, switching
                characters, remaining in spectator and disconnecting from the server.</li>
            <li>Abusing your character’s faction to destroy roleplay for others is not allowed. An example of this
                would be detaining someone and leaving them in a cell without contact for more than 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>You must avoid disrupting any RP situation for any out of character reasons. In addition,
                attempting to interrupt player led or staff approved events can result in a possible blacklist from
                future events or a ban from the server. In severe cases, your character may also be permanently
                killed.</li>
            <li>Your character’s name should be based on the general medieval period. No famous/historical
                names, this includes out of character (I.E: Ryan Gosling) and in-character names (I.E: Charlemagne).
                </li>
                <li>Contact between your own characters in any shape or form is forbidden. Additionally, you may not
                    transfer items or currency between your own characters. This can lead to any characters being
                    permanently killed and a ban, and third party members will be handled at the discretion of server
                    staff.</li>
            <li>If you wish to request a character kill/permanent kill on another player, you must ensure the kill
                follows the CK/PK guidelines.
                </li>
            <li>Asituation cannot be deemed void without UA approval.
            </li>
            <li> If you know taking an action will result in some sort of In-Character consequence, you may not
                leave the server for atleast 30 minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li>Characters should be no younger than 16 years old.
            </li>
            <li>Do not speak in an Out-of-Character manner In-Character. For such, use the (), (()), or / at the end
                of your message to specify a local out-of-character message. This rule does not apply in staff
                situations. Keep global chat free of arguments.</li>
            <li>Forgery of documents is considered powergaming, and is not permitted.</li>
            <li>The act of using an alternate character to avoid repercussions on a different character is not
                allowed.</li>
            <li>Erotic Roleplay (ERP) of any form is forbidden.</li>
            <li>Raids performed on faction buildings by official factions are to be directly approved and overseen
                by a member of Upper Administration. Any raids within the above criteria that have not been approved
                appropriately and overseen by an appropriate member of the staff team are seen as FailRP and RDM
                for any and all individuals who die during said raid.</li>
            <li> If an individual is detained without continuous sufficient roleplay (being trialed, interrogated, etc.)
                for 15 minutes, then the individual must be released. If it is found that a player is not being interacted
                with sufficiently then by staff discretion they can be released.
                </li>
            <li> The use of family names on the server is permitted, however it should be noted that
                dynasties/families may only have 4 members in it at a time, meaning that those 4 can be related and
                have prior knowledge of one another. It should also be noted that the actions of one of your family
                member(s) can reflect upon you and may be used against you.
                </li>
            <li>All protest/riot events require pre-admin approval. Unapproved events will be considered minging
                as it causes issues with the factions and prevents them from roleplaying.
                </li>
            <li>Do not abuse any systems or functions that give you unfair advantage. If you find a bug, glitch or
                flaw that can be abused to obtain an advantage, it is your obligation to report this issue as opposed to
                abusing it. If abused, this can result in serious punishment.

    <h1>Character Rules</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>You may not create a new character with the name of an old character that was CK/PK’d. Nor are
                    you allowed to roleplay as a family member of any of your past or current characters. Your
                    characters should have zero relation to each other.</li>
                <li>You may not create a primary or alternate character for the sole purpose of having them as “throw
                    away’ or designated “minge” characters. Recurring instances of such will result in permanent kills of
                    the character and/or a severe ban.</li>
                <li> If you're roleplaying as a corrupt government character who is working with a crime organisation,
                    you may not have a second character in that crime organisation as it can lead to metagame/using the
                    government character solely for the benefit of the crime organisation.</li>
                <li>The radius or size of the NLR can vary but generally, it means do not return to the same building or
                    area you were killed. Do not loiter just outside the area and do not go seek the same players to create
                    another situation. Attempting to abuse the NLR system or loophole around the rule is not permitted.
                    </li>
                <li> Individuals are exempt from the "New Life Rule’ if:
                    <ul type="a">
                        <li> There is a public announcement describing the situation that occurred (notice board).
                        </li>
                        <li>You are invoked in roleplay,<br>Ex: You are called to a trial or are being arrested for the previous roleplay you
                            partook in.</li>
                        <li>You are a surviving witness and are able to tell the people that were NLR killed what
                            happened. This is all taking into account that your “memory” is refreshed after you died, by
                            someone who witnessed the event that incapacitated you, or by someone who got informed by
                            a witness.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>While under FearRP you are required to oblige by the commands of your captor. If you attempt to
                    escape or pull out a weapon to fight back but are killed that would then display a disregard for your
                    own safety. This is a calculated risk you took, or a denial to value your own life, which will result in
                    your CK/PK.</li>
                <li> Acting in complete disregard for your life and being killed can result ina CK/PK at staff's discretion.</li>
                <li>You must have a valid reason to place someone under Fear RP (I.E: Reason to forcibly detain,
                    question, kidnap or mug). Placing someone under FearRP without reason or just to bait a CK/PK is not
                    permitted and may result in a ban or character death.</li>
                <li>If the player with the weapon puts it away or turns their line of sight away or has entirely shifted
                    their focus away from you, FearRP will no longer be in effect and you may take this window of
                    opportunity to retaliate with little-to-no risk (this does not apply if you are being detained by multiple
                    individuals, as you may choose to retaliate if they retreat but you cannot request a CK/PK on any of
                    them).</li>
                <li>Continually putting yourself into FearRP scenarios in order to CK/PK people is not permitted. If
                    staff feel as if you are performing these acts intentionally with no regard for actual roleplay, they may
                    deny your PK requests and/or issue punishments.</li>
                <li>If you are actively holding a weapon in your hand, FearRP does not apply and you may retaliate.</li>
                <li> If you are under attack at a more than reasonable distance, you may escape without risk
                    (generally measured as an out-of-talk range).</li>
                <li>When attempting to FearRP a horse rider, you must be within stabbing distance of the horse. The
                    horse must be immobilized, either unable to move or in a parked position, or dead. FearRP does not
                    apply to fast-moving riders.
                    </li>
                <li>You may not mug in a public place. You can; however, pull a weapon on them and bring them toa
                    secluded area to rob them (this can only be done when there is no one else around). <br>Ex: The victim is alone at night in the middle of an empty street. You initiate a mugging and take
                    them to an alleyway so no one stumbles upon the crime. You may not perform the mugging in the
                    street, which is a public area.</li>
                <li> Secluded and non-public areas include; Alleys, dark corners, areas void of other players or
                    abandoned buildings (in certain cases when an argument is present regarding the above stated
                    areas, it can be confirmed or denied at the discretion of a staff member).</li>
                <li> You may only kill the victim if they DO NOT comply with your demands. Likewise you may only make
                    realistic demands, this means you cannot demand something unrealistic that the victim cannot deliver
                    in order to kill them.</li>
                <li>You may not kill or attack people for stumbling onto your mugging or witnessing it. You may NOT
                    mug or kidnap players who are busy interacting with an NPC (LE: Armour Stand, Horse Spawner).</li>
                <li>Once you have finished mugging a player who has complied, you must flee the scene and abandon
                    them. You may NOT kill or cripple them unnecessarily, you may not take them as a hostage/kidnapping
                    without proper RP reason; mugging is not a valid reason for kidnapping/ransom.</li>
                <li>You may not mug or kidnap the same person within a span of 60 minutes.</li>
                <li> If you are killed while mugging, you have the possibility of being CK’d/PK’d.</li>
                <li> You may not kill someone or escalate a confrontation to murder just for verbal
                    disrespect/argument. If someone continues to disrespect you, you may physically intimidate or hit
                    them (Fists, melee weapon) as continued disrespect could realistically start a fight. The player then
                    has free choice on how to respond/retaliate. If they choose to flee, you may not kill them.
                        <ul type="a">
                            <li>If the player is attacked, they may flee and return later to exact revenge on the assailant as
                                described under rule 22.</li>
                            <li> If the player is subject to an active threat via weapon, they can choose to break FearRP to
                                retaliate at the risk of a CK/PK or instead leave peacefully; however, they may not return later
                                to attack them without sufficient reason as the previous situation would have already ended.
                                This ultimately would be seen as Revenge RDM.</li>
                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li> If someone is loitering/following/harassing you, you may give them warnings to leave you alone.
                    If they ignore several warnings and continue their actions, you may attack/kill them. (One warning
                    will not suffice, multiple warnings in a very short time span will also not suffice, you have to give them
                    time to react).</li>
                <li> You may kill in self defense or in defense of your partners/faction/property if deemed
                    appropriate.</li>
                <li>You may kill someone in self defense if they have refused multiple requests or commands under
                    gunpoint to leave your private/faction property (in most cases in the case that the offending player
                    has not had previous similar offenses, it will not lead directly to a PK).</li>
                <li> In regards to how a user is allowed to react to verbal threats:
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are two types of threats, an ‘Active Threat’ and an ‘Idle Threat’. Players may kill for an
                            active threat but may not for an idle threat. The difference is situation, but will pertain if the
                            person making the threats has a weapon in their hand. For example, threatening someone with
                            a weapon, claiming that they will kill you, is an Active threat. Someone saying they will kill/beat
                            you (Unarmed) is an Idle threat.</li>
                        <li>You are allowed to react to an Active threat in that moment, but do be aware that breaking
                            FearPP to kill them and dying can result in a CK/PK.</li>
                        <li>You may not initiate either verbally or with the use of what is seen as an “Active Threat” in
                            order to kill or attack a player in the result of their own defense for an instance that you had
                            started. This is considered baiting and will not be taken lightly in recurring situations where
                            staff must intervene. (Ex: You start an argument with someone and/or punch or shoot them
                            to force a confrontation for the sole purpose of killing them).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> You may not kill people for witnessing a crime you committed unless they are a witness to a PK you
                    have executed, this is further explained in rule 3 under General Rules. You can threaten them to
                    ensure they do not report it, but you have to be 100% certain that a player has ratted to the authorities
                    before you can take violent action against them In this case you must have what is considered a “Dirt
                    PK” approved on the individual beforehand (Information regarding PK Guidelines can be found here
                    (LINK). Likewise, you cannot kill innocent bystanders. You must be 100% sure you are killing the right
                    person.</li>
                <li> You may retaliate against anyone (including faction members) who are directly and/or openly
                    acting against yourself or others who you have important connections to in-character (i.e. a member
                    of your family or your criminal organization is being placed under FearRP, or is being dragged while
                    detained / kidnapped). It is to be noted that in the case of which you are out-armed or out-numbered,
                    you must act in accordance with FearPP or killing rules.</li>
                <li> A group member is defined as the following, and will largely apply to civilian characters:

                <ul>
                    <li>They are a member of your faction.</li>
                    <li>You must properly know them in character.</li>
                    <li> You may not attack faction members or interfere when they are detaining someone you do
                        not know.</li>
                    <li>This does not apply to that faction’s members inside of their own property or if your group
                        member is detained inside of a faction building, as this constitutes a raid which MUST be
                        approved by Upper Administration or higher (Faction characters, so long as they are acting
                        appropriately, are allowed to find their own means of breaking into said buildings without staff
                        approval as stated in Rule 24 of General Rules).

    <h1>Powergaming Rules</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Powergaming is described as forcing some form of roleplay onto someone against their will, usually
                in violation of the rules to bring advantage over another player either through means of FailRP or OOC
                material. Using other game mechanics to powergame can include: Attempting to force players to do
                things outside of the server, forcing players to kill their own character, forcing players to commit
                crimes, forcing players to RP or produce actions against their will, etc.
                </li>
            <li>If you are removed from an RP situation or were critically involved, you are not allowed to return on
                a second character. If you were removed from an RP situation on one character or are involved ona
                separate character, you cannot return ona second character in an attempt to continue or influence it.</li>
            <li>You may not fabricate evidence to force a roleplay situation nor can you take OOC matters into IC

                Organisations that provide little-to-no impact towards roleplay, or of whom are inactive can be
                removed at the discretion of any member of the staff team above or equal to the rank of Supervisor

                    fully heal you or the individual you use them on. Instead, they act as an aid, allowing the person
                    better movement speed and capability to defend themselves if an attacker rushes them.
                    <br>
                    (i. ‘Capability to defend’ is understood as - If an enemy rushes at you or the individual -
                    you may strike them again. You may NOT actively pursue combat once more.)</li>
                <li>You may spit, kick, bite, or anything within the reasonable limits of detainment, if you are
                    cuffed.
                    <br>
                    (i. Should you do so, you are running into the risk of being killed (Character Rule 7) and
                    CK/PkK’'d for disregard of one’s life at the discretion of the captor’s & the staff.)
                    </li>

        </li>
        <li> If during InjuryRP you type *bleeds out* without the other party agreeing, it will be considered
            powergaming.
            </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Romance Guidelines</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marriages and non-sexual character relations are considered RomanceRP and are allowed.
            <ul type="a">
                <li>People who partake in RomanceRP must be above the age of consent.
                    <br>
                    (i. The age of consent is 18.)
                    </li>
                    <li>Forcing RomanceRP in any capacity on another player will result in permanent suspension.
                    </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Community members who lie about their age to achieve romance or cause trouble for others will be
            permanently suspended.
            </li>
        <li>RomanceRP between two people who know one another and are both above the age of consent (18)
            is allowed.
                <ul>
                    <li>We, as staff, understand that some people find RomanceRP to be an enjoyable, however we
                        strongly advise anyone who partakes in it to be sure that the person they attempt to romance
                        is above the age of consent. All cases will be scrutinized on a case-to-case basis where the
                        concern for safety is brought up to the Staff Team. Where the safoty is displaced, permanent
                        suspensions will follow.
                        </li>
                </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Torture Guidelines</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>TortureRP is allowed if the player doesn’t make it excessively gory or descriptive.

            <ul type="a">
                <li>If gore is required, consent from the target is necessary.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    <h2>Age Guidelines</h2>
    <ol>

            <ul type="a">
                <li>Including factors such as reputation, previous experience, ban history, staff opinion, and
                    quality of roleplay as well as any other optional information requested by staff such as, but not
                    restricted to, a detailed character lore.
                    </li>
                <li>If a player has magical abilities or otherwise wields magical items, the wielder must know:
                    <br>
                    (i. If a player is found to be using magic for powergaming purposes, strict punishment
                    may follow.)
                    <br>
                    (ii. If a player is found using magical items for powergaming purposes, these items may

                <li> If a player is endowed with magical abilities or otherwise wields magical items, the wielder

                    <br>
                    (i. Magically endowed characters may not instantly transfer information to another
                    character. They may not use telekinesis, magical projections, or enchanted

                    <br>
                    (i. Under no circumstances may a magically endowed character render themselves
                    fully invincible, immortal or invulnerable. The only exception is using magic to slow
                    character aging process.)
